Distrubute an Application Across the swarm cluster.
______________________________________________________________________

lets edit one host file and declare master and worker node

>sudo vi /etc/hosts

it will open the file with vi editor
>press i so your can edit the file below localhost press enter and add below mentioned thing

172.31.4.13 master
172.31.5.139 worker1

press esc type :wq! press enter so file saved successfully.

let's try to connect with this nodes.

>ping master
connect then stop by using ctrl+c
>ping worker1
stop by ctrl+c
__________________________________________________________________________

initialize a swarm cluster by using below command
>sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.4.13 (MasterNode Ip)

(if already initialized swarm then need to leave the swarm cluster first)
>sudo docker swarm leave --force

once swarm initialied it will give to command to connect from worker node copy that and execute with sudo from worker node. If connect then go the master node

>sudo docker node ls

(you can see here the list of node where one node is learder and one node is worker)

let's create service with 2 replicas

sudo docker service create --name clusterservice --publish 8081:8081 --replicas 2 sonamsoni/phpwebsite

-- clusterservice is the name of service
-- replicas will create a number of replicas mentioned
-- publish will publish service on given port number
-- sonamsoni/phpwebsite is my image which is pushed dockerhub (so docker will serahc this image from dockerhub then pull it and then it will create service as required)

(Note: for pulling the image docker login command must be executed beore that then only will works)

once the service converged then execute below command to see the services are running on which node

> sudo docker service ps clusterservice

(you can see one service is running on master node and one is running on worker node)
