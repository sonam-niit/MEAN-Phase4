3. Deploy a Docker Container on a Docker Swarm

initialize a Docker swarm
>sudo docker swarm init

where you have executed this command will become a Leader node.
check the status of your node
>sudo docker node ls

let's create a service to this docker swarm

>sudo docker service create -p 80:80 --name myservice phpcode

check the service status

>docker service ls

>curl localhost:80

(application runing with service created)

If you want to check the details of the service
>sudo docker service ps myservice
(Note: Everytime if you are getting error of permission denied to execute any command you can access with sudo or execute below mentioned command for the permission access)

>sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock

Let's Scale It

>docker service scale myservice=3
>docker service ls
>docker service ps myservice
